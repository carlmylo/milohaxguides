Rock Band 3 can delete a song in-game. However, if a song is part of a pack, it'll delete that entire pack as well.

The best way to remove a song from a pack is through Nautilus' `Quick Pack Editor`.

<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `Quick Pack Editor`.

2. Open a file browser window and navigate to the pack folder that contains the song you want to remove and look for the `songs.dta` file.  
It will usually be in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\[PACKNAME]\songs`.

3. Drag the `songs.dta` file into the `Quick Pack Editor`.  
Select the songs you want to remove then click `Remove selected`.  
When you're done, click `Save` to lock your changes in.

4. Even though the song is deleted from the `songs.dta` file, they will still take up space.  
You have to delete the song's corresponding folder as well.
