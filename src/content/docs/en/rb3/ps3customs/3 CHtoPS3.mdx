<Aside type="caution">DISCLAIMER - READ BEFORE CONTINUING</Aside>
  Do this as a **last resort** if the charts you want to convert were specifically made for PC clone games (Clone Hero/YARG). If the chart originally existed in RB format, whether it be official DLC or customs, **get that first and follow [[the Xbox 360 to PS3 guide]](../360tops3/)!**

**Failure to do so will result in lost metadata** associated with the original song package, including:
* Incompatibility with any song upgrades in RB3DX
* Keys, Pro Guitar, Harmonies, & chart fixes to legacy RB songs that didn't have them
* Incompatibility with online play and leaderboards
* Animation data such as character lipsync will be lost

Should you decide to ignore the disclaimer and proceed, you will be **refused any support** from the MiloHax Discord if you run into any issues.

<Aside type="caution">**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**</Aside>

#### 1.
After downloading the charts you want, open Onyx and select `Batch recompile`.  
<Image src={onyxbatch} alt="Onyx's main screen. A cursor hovers over 'Batch recompile'." />

#### 2.
At the top of the Batch Recompile window, click on `Edit` then `Preferences`.  
<Image src={onyxbatchprefs} alt="Onyx's Batch Recompile. The 'Edit' menu has been expanded and 'Preferences' is selected." />

#### 3.
Switch to the `Rock Band` tab. 
Change to `Magma optional`.  
<Image src={onyxbatchprefsrb} alt="Onyx's Preferences window. Under the 'Rock Band' tab, 'Magma optional' is selected." />

#### 4.
You will be warned about this.  
Click `OK`.  
<Image src={onyxbatchwarn} alt="A warning from Onyx. It warns that disabling Magma will crash Rock Band." />

#### 5.
Switch to the `Audio` tab. 
Lower the `OGG Vorbis quality` to `3.00`.  
After that, click on `Save`.  
<Image src={onyxbatchprefsaud} alt="Onyx's Preferences window. Under the 'Audio' tab, 'Magma optional' is selected." />

#### 6.
Drag and drop the folder(s) containing the songs you want to convert into the `Batch recompile` window.

#### 7.
Switch to the `RB3` tab.  
*(Optional)*: Most Clone Hero songs only have Guitar charted. You may wish to copy it over to other instruments such as Bass/Keys to allow more people to play it at the same time.  
<Image src={onyxbatchparts} alt="Onyx's Batch Recompile window. Under the 'RB3' tab, 'Fill empty parts with first guitar, then drums' is selected." />

#### 8.
Pick between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP.  
It is **much** faster than PKG creation and can create packs larger than 4GB (4000 MiB).
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs or if you want to share packs.

  	<Image src={onyxbatchfolders} alt="Onyx's Batch Recompile window. Under the 'RB3' tab, 'Create PS3/RPCS3 folders' is selected." />

#### 9.
If you're on RPCS3, find and select the `dev_hdd0` folder. This is usually in the folder where RPCS3 is installed to.  
If youâ€™re on PS3, pick whichever folder is the most convenient.  
<Image src={savefolder} alt="A file browser window with a location set and the cursor over 'Select Folder'." />

#### 10.
If you're on RPCS3, it will auto-install into your RPCS3 directory, ready to play.  
If you're on PS3, you'll have a pack folder ready to transfer to `dev_hdd0/game/BLUS30463/USRDIR` via FTP.

#### 9.
Select where you would like to save the PKG file and give it a name.  
<Image src={savepkgfolder} alt="A file browser window with a location set and the cursor over 'Select Folder'." />

#### 10.
It should successfully convert and a PKG file will be created, ready to install.  
Simply install it like any other PKG.
