Over time, you might amass a large amount of customs folders, especially if you're installing individual songs.  
This is a problem since, the more folders you have, the longer Rock Band 3 takes to count your songs.  
<Image src={rb3merge} alt="Rock Band 3 loading downloaded content. It is loading 94 packages." />  

Ideally, you should put as many songs as possible into a pack to load things efficiently.  
<Image src={rb3mergeafter} alt="Rock Band 3 loading downloaded content. It is loading 48 packages." />  

Thanks to Onyx, you can do this easily! It is basically the same as the earlier as [[the Xbox 360 CON to PS3/RPCS3 format tutorial]](../360tops3/).  

<Aside>Keep in mind that you will temporarily need to have the original separated packs and the merged pack installed.  
Make sure you have enough space!</Aside>

#### 1.
Open a file browser and navigate to where your customs are installed.  
This is normally within `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\`.  
For PS3, you will have to transfer the folder you want to combine to your computer for processing, which may take a while.  
If you're on RPCS3, you can get there quickly by right clicking Rock Band 3 within RPCS3 then `Open Folder > Open Game Data Folder`.  
<Image src={rpcs3gamedata} alt="RPCS3 with 'Open Game Data Folder', within the 'Open Folder' menu, highlighted and with a cursor over it." />

#### 2.
Open Onyx Music Game Toolkit and click `Quick convert/pack`.  
<Image src={onyxhomequick} alt="Onyx's main screen. A cursor hovers over 'Quick convert/pack'." />

#### 3.
Stay on the `RB quick convert + pack creator` tab.  
You can either drag and drop the files you modified or click on `Add Rock Band Song` to select them.  
<Image src={onyxdraganddropmerge} alt="Folders of customs being dragged and dropped into the 'RB quick convert + pack creator' tab of Onyx." />

It is also recommended to enable `Author to DTA tag` at the bottom right.  
<Image src={onyxauthormerge} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. 'Author to DTA' is highlighted and has a cursor over it." />

#### 4.
Below the first row of gray buttons, click the first menu and select `Make Packs`.  
<Image src={onyxmakepacksmerge} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. 'Make songs: produced a single file for each song' has been clicked and the cursor is over 'Make packs: combine songs up to a maximum file size'." />

#### 5.
At the bottom left, pick between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP.  
It is **much** faster than PKG creation and can create packs larger than 4GB (4000 MiB).
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs or if you want to share packs.

  <TabItem label="Folders (PS3)">
    <Image src={onyxoutfoldermerge} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is selecting 'Folders (PS3)' and 'Encrypted .mid.edat' has been enabled." />
<Aside>**Deluxe users can disable this. This will will require <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[an up to date version of Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</a>.  
  It is _MUCH_ faster with this disabled.**</Aside>

#### 6.
_(Optional but highly recommended)_  
By default, Onyx will generate a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like `OxxxxxSongName`.  
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change `Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack` to `Custom USRDIR subfolder`.  
<Image src={onyxfoldernamerpcs3merge} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is selecting 'Custom USRDIR subfolder' where 'Keep original USRDIR subfolders' once was." />

To keep things organized, you should name your packed folder something that makes it easy to find.  
<Image src={onyxnamepack} alt="Onyx's USRDIR naming popup. The pack has been named 'my_custom_pack'." />

#### 7.
At the bottom, select the big button labeled `Make pack`.  
<Image src={onyxmakepackrpcs3merge} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is over 'Make 1 pack.'" />

If you're on RPCS3, find and select the `dev_hdd0` folder. This is usually in the folder where RPCS3 is installed to.  
If youâ€™re on PS3, pick whichever folder is the most convenient.  
<Image src={savefolder} alt="A file browser window. 'dev_hdd0' is selected and the cursor is over 'Select folder'." />

If you're on RPCS3, it will auto-install into your RPCS3 directory, ready to play.  
If you're on PS3, you'll have a pack folder ready to transfer to `dev_hdd0/game/BLUS30463/USRDIR` via FTP.  
<Image src={onyxcreatedrpcs3merge} alt="Onyx's USRDIR naming popup. The pack has been named 'my_custom_pack'." />

<Aside>Remember to delete the original unmerged folders when you're done!</Aside>

_(Optional but highly recommended)_  
By default, Onyx will generate a PKG that outputs a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like `OxxxxxSongName`.  
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change `Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack` to `Custom USRDIR subfolder`.

Select where you would like to save the PKG file and give it a name.  
<Image src={savepkg} alt="A file browser window. The file name has been set to 'my_custom_pack'." />

It should successfully convert and a PKG file will be created, ready to install.  
Simply install it like any other PKG.
