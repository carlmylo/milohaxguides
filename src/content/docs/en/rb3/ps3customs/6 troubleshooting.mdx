## Customs not working online / Scores not saving
Rock Band 3 can only remember scores for numeric song IDs. If you didn't follow [[the main Xbox 360 to PS3 guide]](../360tops3), chances are you will bump into songs that have letters in the song ID.  
Those songs will generate a new ID and wipe your score every time the game starts.

While online, these songs will grey even if you and other players have the same song installed. To avoid this, the song needs to have a numeric ID.  
<Image src={missingsong} alt="Rock Band 3 showing songs with a darker color as they are disabled." />

You can solve this issue by correcting the IDs with Nautilus.
### Fixing IDs Before Installing
<Steps>
1. Simply follow [[the main Xbox 360 to PS3 guide]](../360tops3).  
This is automatically fixed.
</Steps>

### Fixing IDs of Installed Songs
<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `PS3 Converter`.  
    <Image src={nautilushomeps3} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'PS3 Converter'." />

2. At the top of the `PS3 Converter` window, go to:  
`Numeric ID Options > Batch replace song IDs`  
    <Image src={nautilusps3batchid} alt="Nautilus's PS3 Converter. A cursor hovers over 'Batch replace song IDs' under the 'Numeric ID Options' menu." />

3. On either PS3 or RPCS3, navigate to song/pack containing the song with the bad ID (normally within `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\[SONGNAME]\songs`).  
After finding it, select the `songs.dta` file within the folder.  
    <Image src={nautilusps3batchselect} alt="A file browser window. 'dev_hdd0' is selected and the cursor is over 'Open'." />

4. Wait for it to finish correcting every song within that pack.  
When it finishes, you can share the fixed `songs.dta` file with your friends to play the previously unavailable songs together.

</Steps>

## Songs Stuck Looping at the End
Occasionally certain songs may freeze toward the end of the chart, constantly looping the last bits of the audio endlessly.  
* **You will need to uninstall the song. Check [[the deletion guide]](../delete) if needed!**
* **You will need need the original CON file to fix this issue!**
* **Do not run every song through this if it does not need fixing, the audio will be re-encoded and will have a slight decrease in audio quality**

<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `PS3 Converter`.  
    <Image src={nautilushomeps3} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'PS3 Converter'." />

2. At the top of the `PS3 Converter` window, go to:  
`Tools > Batch fix looping songs`  
    <Image src={nautilusps3batchloop} alt="Nautilus's PS3 Converter. A cursor hovers over 'Batch fix looping songs' under the 'Tools' menu." />

3. Go to the folder where the problematic CON is at and select the folder.  
Wait for it to finish.  
    <Image src={nautilusps3batchloopproc} alt="Nautilus's PS3 Converter. It is in the process of fixing a looping file." />

4. After it's done, you can go back to step 4 of [[the main tutorial]](./360tops3/).
</Steps>

## PS3: Greyed out customs
By default, the PlayStation 3's Parental Controls are set to level 9.  
This doesn't allow customs that are classified as "Unrated", causing them to appear grey.  
<Image src={ps3grey} alt="Rock Band 3's song library showing a greyed out song." />

Selecting these songs will cause a crash.
To fix this, set the `Parental Control` to `Off` in:  
XMB: [ **Settings** ] -> [ **Security Settings** ] -> [ **Parental Control** ] -> [ **Off** ]  
<Image src={ps3parental} alt="The parental control menu in PlayStation 3's XMB home menu. The level is set to 'Off'." />

## Songs still infinite loading
In very rare cases, songs might still have infinite loading, even after the using PS3 fixer.  

You can fix this with Nautilus' Batch Cryptor.  
<Aside>**This requires <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[an install of the latest Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</a>.**</Aside>
<Steps>
1. Open Nautilus and select `Batch Cryptor`.  
    <Image src={nautilushomecrypt} alt="Nautilus' main screen with a cursor hovering over 'Batch Cryptor'." />

2. Swap to `Decrypt` at the bottom of the screen.  
    <Image src={nautiluscryptdecrypt} alt="Batch Cryptor with the mode switched to 'Decrypt'." />

3. For both PS3 and RPCS3 users, navigate to the folder containing the song you wish to fix.  
It will usually be in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR\[PACKNAME]\songs\[PROBLEMATICSONG]`).  
There will be a `.mogg` file in the song's folder.  
    <Image src={findmogg} alt="A file browser window with a mogg file is selected." />

4. Drag and drop the song's `.mogg` file onto `Batch Cryptor` and click `Begin`.  
    <Image src={nautiluscryptdecryptmogg} alt="An animation of a .mogg file being dropped into 'Batch Cryptor' the being decrypted." />

5. A new folder called `decrypted` will appear when it finishes.  
Go into the new `decrypted` folder and cut the `.mogg` file inside of it.  
Go back to the song's main folder and replace the old `.mogg` file.  
    <Image src={moggreplace} alt="An animation of a .mogg file within the 'decrypted' folder being cut then pasted in the folder before it. It replaces the old .mogg file." />
