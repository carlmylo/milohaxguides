<Aside type="caution">If you wish to convert official Harmonix Xbox 360 DLC, [[skip to step 6]](#6), otherwise continue reading below:</Aside>

#### 1.
<a href="https://rhythmverse.co/songfiles/game/rb3xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Download the songs of your choice from RhythmVerse]</a>.  
<a href="https://rhythmverse.co/songfiles/game/rb3xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={rhythmverse} alt="The RhythmVerse website. The cursor is over the Download button." /></a>


#### 2.
Open Nautilus and select `PS3 Converter`.  
<Image src={nautilushomeps3} alt="Nautilus' main screen. A cursor hovers over 'PS3 Converter'." />

#### 3.
From the `Tools` menu select `One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer`.  
Click `OK` on the message box that appears.  
<Image src={nautilusps3oneclick} alt="A file browser window. A folder named 'Customs' is selected and the cursor is over 'Select folder'." />

#### 4.
Select the folder where you stored your customs.  
<Image src={selectconfolder} alt="A file browser window. A folder named 'Customs' is selected and the cursor is over 'Select folder'." />

#### 5.
Any files needing audio encryption or downmixing for PS3 will be processed.  
When it's done, you can close Nautilus.  
<Image src={nautilusps3fixerdone} alt="Nautilus's PS3 Converter. A cursor hovers over 'One-Click Batch PS3 Fixer'." />

#### 6.
Open Onyx Music Game Toolkit and click `Quick convert/pack`.  
<Image src={onyxhomequick} alt="Onyx's main screen. A cursor hovers over 'Quick convert/pack'." />

#### 7.
Stay on the `RB quick convert + pack creator` tab.  
You can either drag and drop the files you modified or click on `Add Rock Band Song` to select them.  
<Image src={onyxdraganddrop} alt="Customs in CON format being dragged and dropped into the 'RB quick convert + pack creator' tab of Onyx." />

It is also recommended to enable `Author to DTA tag` at the bottom right.  
<Image src={onyxauthor} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. 'Author to DTA' is highlighted and has a cursor over it." />

#### 8.
Below the first row of gray buttons, click the first menu and select `Make Packs` or `Make Songs` depending on how you want to combine your songs.  
**Packs are recommended**.  
<Image src={onyxmakepacks} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. 'Make songs: produced a single file for each song' has been clicked and the cursor is over 'Make packs: combine songs up to a maximum file size'." />

#### 9.
At the bottom left, pick between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP.  
It is **much** faster than PKG creation and can create packs larger than 4GB (4000 MiB).
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs or if you want to share packs.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Folders (PS3)">
  	<Image src={onyxoutfolder} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is selecting 'Folders (PS3)' and 'Encrypted .mid.edat' has been enabled." />
<Aside>**Deluxe users can disable this. This will will require <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[an up to date version of Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</a>.  
  It is _MUCH_ faster with this disabled.  
It's suggested to keep this enabled if you're going to share your packs!**</Aside>

#### 10.
_(Optional but highly recommended)_  
By default, Onyx will generate a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like `OxxxxxSongName`.  
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change `Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack` to `Custom USRDIR subfolder`.  
<Image src={onyxfoldernamerpcs3} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is selecting 'Custom USRDIR subfolder' where 'Keep original USRDIR subfolders' once was." />

It's suggested for single songs too, as it's easier to locate a song you already installed within the game files.  
<Image src={onyxnamepack} alt="Onyx's USRDIR naming popup. The pack has been named 'my_custom_pack'." />

#### 11.
At the bottom, select the big button labeled `Make pack` (or `Start` if you used the `Make Songs` option.)  
<Image src={onyxmakepackrpcs3} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is over 'Make 1 pack.'" />

If you're on RPCS3, find and select the `dev_hdd0` folder. This is usually in the folder where RPCS3 is installed to.  
If youâ€™re on PS3, pick whichever folder is the most convenient.  
<Image src={savefolder} alt="A file browser window. 'dev_hdd0' is selected and the cursor is over 'Select folder'." />

If you're on RPCS3, it will auto-install into your RPCS3 directory, ready to play.  
If you're on PS3, you'll have a pack folder ready to transfer to `dev_hdd0/game/BLUS30463/USRDIR` via FTP.  
<Image src={onyxcreatedrpcs3} alt="Onyx's USRDIR naming popup. The pack has been named 'my_custom_pack'." />

By default, Onyx will generate a PKG that outputs a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like `OxxxxxSongName`.  
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change `Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack` to `Custom USRDIR subfolder`.

<Image src={onyxmakepackpkg} alt="Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is over 'Make 1 pack'." />

Select where you would like to save the PKG file and give it a name.  
<Image src={savepkg} alt="A file browser window. The file name has been set to 'my_custom_pack'." />

It should successfully convert and a PKG file will be created, ready to install.  
Simply install it like any other PKG.  
<Image src={onyxcreatedpkg} alt="Onyx's USRDIR naming popup. The pack has been named 'my_custom_pack'." />
