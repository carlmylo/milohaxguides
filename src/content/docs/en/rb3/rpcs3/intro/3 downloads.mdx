Before you begin, **make sure your drivers and operating system are up to date**.

## Prerequisites

**Let's start by downloading 7-Zip**, which will open the compressed .7z archives most of these downloads will be stored inside of. **If you already have 7-Zip** or an alternative installed, you can **skip to the next step**.

[**[Click here to go to 7-Zip's download page]**](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

**Now**, **let's** go ahead and **install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable**, which is required by RPCS3. You probably already have this, but it doesn't hurt to double check.

[**[Click here to download Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable]**](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

**Once it finishes downloading**, open it up and **install it**.

## RPCS3

**Next**, let's **download RPCS3**.

[**[Click here to go to RPCS3's download site]**](https://rpcs3.net/download).

Scroll down a bit and download the Windows version.

**Once it downloads, extract the .7z file.**  
![A screenshot of the right click menu from Windows Explorer highlighting "Extract files..." from the 7-Zip category.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/extractrpcs3.png "Extract Files")

We suggest extracting the files into `C:\Games\RPCS3` or a separate internal drive to avoid permissions issues. Also, untick the box that will create a sub-directory, as shown highlighted in the picture.  

<Aside type="danger">**Do not use a USB drive or from a synced folder (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.), as this usually leads to an unstable experience!**</Aside>

## Firmware

Once that's extracted, [**[download the PlayStation 3 system software from Sony's website]**](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/). **Scroll down** until you get **to** "**Update using a computer**." **Click that** to expand, **then click on "Download PS3 Update.**"  
  
_**If you're using a Chromium-based browser like Chrome or Edge, MAKE SURE YOU RIGHT-CLICK AND "Save link as," or your download MAY become stuck.**_
