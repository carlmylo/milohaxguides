## Instructions
There are two different ways to connect this Pro Guitar. If you don't have the Rock Band Mustang Receiver for PlayStation 3, you will need to use MIDI to USB.  
Pick whichever is the most convenient for you:

  <TabItem label="RB3 Mustang Receiver for PlayStation 3 (Recommended)">

**You will need:**

* a PlayStation 3 Wireless Mustang Receiver to connect to the Santroller based adapter.  
> ![Dongle for the RB3 Mustang Guitar](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/ps3/recprotar.png "Dongle for the RB3 Mustang Guitar")

<Steps>
1. Connect your RB3 Wireless Mustang Receiver for PlayStation 3 to your computer.

2. Now, **<a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[go to Zadig's website]</a>** and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

3. Click on `Options` then `List All Devices`.  
    <Image src={zadiglistall} alt="Zadig showing 'List All Devices' under 'Options' highlighted." />

4. You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to `Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`**.  
    <Image src={zadigsel} alt="Zadig showing 'Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3' highlighted in the devices listed." />

5. **After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver.  
_MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE RB3 WIRELESS MUSTANG RECEIVER!!_**  
Click `Replace Driver`.  
    <Image src={zadigreplace} alt="Zadig with 'Replace Driver' highlighted." />

6. A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your RB3 Wireless Mustang receiver.** After you have made sure, **click** **`Yes`**.  
    <Image src={zadigwarning} alt="Zadig warning the user that they're about to modify a system driver, with 'Yes' highlighted" />

7. It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.  
    <Image src={zadigprogress} alt="Zadig in the middle of a driver install." />

8. If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
    <Image src={zadigdone} alt="Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with 'Close' highlighted." />

9. **Close Zadig** and, **with the dongle** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.
Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.

</Steps>

You will see the instrument ready to join in Rock Band 3, .

From this point, you can just connect your RB3 Wireless Mustang receiver whenever you want without having to repeat this setup process!

<summary>Uninstalling</summary>
Applying a Zadig driver on a device will make it only work on applications with passthrough. Thankfully, reverting this is very easy.  
<Steps>
1. Open the Start menu and search for `Device Manager`. Open it.  
    <Image src={startdevman} alt="Windows' Start menu, with a result of 'Device Manager'." />

2. Scroll down until you find the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category.  
Expand it and right click the instrument you applied the Zadig driver on and then select `Uninstall device`.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3`).  
    <Image src={devman} alt="Device Manager, with a right click menu that popped up. The cursor is over 'Uninstall Device.'" />

3. In the next window that pops up, make sure to tick `Attempt to remove the driver for this device.`  
4. After that, click `Uninstall` and that's it!  
    <Image src={devmanun} alt="The device uninstall prompt. 'Attempt to remove the driver for this device' is ticked and the cursor is over 'Uninstall.'" />
</Steps>
When you disconnect then reconnect the device, it will revert back to the original driver.

## SYSEX Notice

<Aside type="caution">**You need a MIDI to USB Interface that has SYSEX support!  
Consult your MIDI to USB interface's manual or manufacturer for more details.**</Aside>

| Verified<br>MIDI to USB interfaces</br> |
|:------------------:|
| **CME**<br>C2MIDI Pro</br> |
| **CME**<br>U2MIDI Pro</br> |
| **Focusrite**<br>Scarlett (4i4 and higher) [3rd Gen]</br> |
| **M-Audio**<br>Midisport Uno</br> |
| **MOTU**<br>M2/M4</br> |
| **Roland**<br>UM-ONE mk2</br> |
| **SSL**<br>+2 MKII</br> |

## Instructions
Since you can't use the dongle, you will need to connect Rock Band 3 Pro Guitar via the MIDI port on the bottom.  
> <Image src={midimustang} alt="A Rock Band 3 Mustang Pro Guitar showing a 5-DIN MIDI output highlighted in blue with a dotted white outline." />

**For this, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.  
Here’s an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you’ve plugged it in correctly, you should see “MIDI In” blinking when you press a key**.  
> <Image src={miditousb} alt="A MIDI to USB interface." />

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.  
> <Image src={midifs} alt="The back of a Focusrite Scarlett showing a USB port, and 5-DIN MIDI input and output." />

After that, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, **then click on `Change Custom Configuration`**.  
> <Image src={iog} alt="Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings showing Emulated MIDI Devices, device type, and device selection highlighted in tan with a solid outline." />

* ![A tan square with a solid outline](/milohaxguides/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square"):  
    * 🎸 **Change your “Emulated MIDI type” from “Keyboard” to “Guitar (17 Frets)” if you have a Mustang Pro Guitar, or “Guitar (22 Frets)” if you have a Squier Pro Guitar, then select your MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it.**
