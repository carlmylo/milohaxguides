## NOTES

* **This is specifically for the** [**[Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host]**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723)**!** Please consult your sales receipt to confirm that it is indeed an [[Adafruit Feather RP2040 **with USB Type A Host**]](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723).
* While you can use the Xbox One Riffmaster too but you should just use [[RB4InstrumentMapper]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls_rb4gtr_xbox) for that instead.

**Click on the `Pads` icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## Setup

Download the latest version of Santroller.

[![A screenshot of Santroller's Github download page, hovering over the Windows installer.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/dlsan.png)](https://github.com/Santroller/Santroller/releases "SantrollerConfigurator")

After downloading Santroller, open "SantrollerConfigurator".

![A screenshot of a cursor hovering over SantrollerConfigurator on a user's desktop](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/opensan.png "SantrollerConfigurator")

Hold the "Boot" button on your Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host if you're plugging it into your computer for the first time.

![A picture of an Adafruit Feather RP2040. A button labeled "Boot" is circled in white, red, and black.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/bootada.jpg "Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host")

In SantrollerConfigurator, set "`Input Type`" to "`USB Adapter`." The Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host should be detected as "`Raspberry Pi Pico`." Click "`Configure`" after doing this.

![A screenshot of SantrollerConfigurator, with a cursor hovering over "USB Adapter," next to "Input Type."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/sanusb.png "SantrollerConfigurator")

Give it a moment to program initial configuration. When prompted, click on "`Configure`" again.
![A screenshot of SantrollerConfigurator, with a cursor hovering over "USB Adapter," next to "Input Type."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/sanconf.png "SantrollerConfigurator")

After you've loaded into the configuration page, scroll down to the "`Presets`" section and click to expand it. Once expanded, click on "`Import Settings from File`"

A community made preset exists (courtesy of jnack) to help speed things up. Load it up via the "Import Settings from File" option.  
[[Download the picoconfig preset here]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/RiffmasterFeather.picoconfig)

![A screenshot of SantrollerConfigurator, with a cursor hovering over "Import Settings from File" under the "Presets" configuration.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/sanpreload.png "Presets")

After loading the preset, **MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "`Save Settings`" before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

## Mapping

By default, XInput has most things bound correctly. You only need to remap the following:

| **RPCS3** | **XInput** | **Guitar** |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| R1 | ![Right Stick](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rs.png "Right Stick") | ![Tilt](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/guitars/ts.gif "Tilt") | 
| L2 | ![Right Stick Click](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rsc.png "Right Stick Click") | ![Solo Buttons](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/guitars/solo.png "Solo Buttons") | 
| Right Stick: <br>Down</br> | ![Left Trigger](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/lt.png "Left Trigger") | ![Effects Switch](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/guitars/fx.png "Effects Switch") |

#### Profile

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/Xbox%20Rock%20Band%20Drums.7z)

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input_configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in `Devices`, next to the `Refresh` button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

## Additional Notes
The picoconfig preset binds a few things for a better experience with a PS4 Riffmaster.  
- The "Boot" button on the Adafruit Feather RP2040 with USB Type A Host will act as a guide button as pressing and holding the guide button on the Riffmaster shuts it off.
- D-Pad: Left and Select are swapped as the PlayStation Riffmaster. This is because, by default, the PlayStation Riffmaster has Overdrive activation bound to D-Pad Left which is very uncomfortable.

If you wish to remove these tweaks, click the "`Remove`" next to the D-pad Left and Back buttons at the bottom of Santroller Configurator.

![A screenshot of SantrollerConfigurator, scrolled to the bottom. There are circles over the "Remove" buttons next to Back and D-pad Left.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/sanrem.png "SantrollerConfigurator")

After that, go to the "`Usb Host Inputs`" section and enable the original buttons again.

![A screenshot of SantrollerConfigurator, in the "Usb Host Inputs" section. There are circles over the disabled Back and D-pad Left buttons, showing them as disabled.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/feather/sanhostin.png "Usb Host Inputs")
