Do NOT map this instrument via the `Pads` menu!

<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) **will** cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a <a href="../../main#gamepads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]</a></Aside>
* Your MIDI Drum Kit needs to:
	* **be set to MIDI Channel 10.**
	* **be set to standard GM mapping.**  
These should be default settings but consult the manual for your MIDI Drum Kit to make sure.
* D-Pad: Left and D-Pad: Right cannot be used. This makes slowing down practice mode and cycling through trainers impossible.
	* You can get a <a href="https://rolllimitless.com/roll-limitless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Roll Limitless]</a> to avoid this.
		* You can also get the <a href="https://rolllimitless.com/roll-limitless-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Roll Limitless Mini]</a> if you don't need MIDI connections.

## Setting Up
**If your MIDI Drum Kit has a USB port**, all you need to do is **plug it into your computer**.  
><Image src={usbdrums} alt="A MIDI Drum Kit's module, showing a USB port." />

**If your MIDI Drum Kit only has a MIDI output, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.  
><Image src={mididrums} alt="A MIDI Drum Kit's module, showing a 5-DIN MIDI output highlighted in blue with a dotted blue outline." />

Here's an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity.  
**To check that you've plugged it in correctly, you should see "MIDI In" blinking when you hit a pad**.  
><Image src={miditousb} alt="A MIDI to USB interface." />

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs.  
For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.  
><Image src={midifs} alt="A Focusrite Scarlett's rear, showing a USB port, and 5-DIN MIDI input and output." />

Find whichever way is the most convenient for you then connect your MIDI Drum Kit to your computer.

After that, **right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on `Change Custom Configuration`.  
<Image src={rpcs3customconfigchange} alt="RPCS3's right click menu, showing 'Change Custom Configuration' highlighted." />

After that, go to the `I/O` tab.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline](/milohaxguides/assets/rb3pc/config/smalltan.png "Tan Square") : 
	* 🥁 **Change your `Emulated MIDI type` from `Keyboard` to `Drums`, then select your MIDI Drum Kit or MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.

## Combos
Since your drum kit has no joypad buttons, you have to use combos to access important menus.  
Do these combos quickly to access the following menus:
* `START`: Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Snare
* `SELECT`: Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Snare Rim
* Song select shortcut: Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Close Hi-Hat Pedal, Kick

If you want to change these, please refer to the [[additional setup section]](#additional-setup)

## Additional Setup
You can adjust a variety of options in the `rb3drums.yml` file, located within the `config` folder inside your RPCS3 installation folder.  
Below are the defaults and what each option does. You will have to reboot the game to apply the settings.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| `Pulse width ms: 30` | How long each drum pad hit is "held" for. **You should leave this alone.** |
| `Minimum velocity: 10` | The minimum velocity (how hard a pad is hit) needed for a signal to be sent.<br>Anything below this number will not send a signal.</br>|
| `Combo window in milliseconds: 2000` | Determines how long you have to press the Combos for Start, Select, and Kick Hold.<br>Values are in milliseconds. Read [[Combos]](#combos) for more information.</br>|
| `Stagger cymbal hits: true` | If you hit two cymbals at the same time, one will be delayed by the "Pulse width ms" above.<br>**You should leave this alone.**</br>|
| `Midi id to note override: ""` | Allows you to remap what each MIDI note does.<br>Read [[Remapping]](#remapping) for more information.</br>|
| `Combo Start: HihatPedal,HihatPedal,HihatPedal,Snare` | Defines what combo will trigger the Start button.<br>Read [[Combos]](#combos) for more information.</br>|
| `Combo Select: HihatPedal,HihatPedal,HihatPedal,SnareRim` | Defines what combo will trigger the Select button.<br>Read [[Combos]](#combos) for more information.</br>|
| `Combo Toggle Hold Kick: HihatPedal,HihatPedal,HihatPedal,Kick` | Defines what combo will trigger the Hold Kick action, for library navigation.<br>Read [[Combos]](#combos) for more information.</br>|
| `Midi CC status: 176` | Defines the status byte. Can be notated as `0xB0` as well.<br>**You should leave this alone.**</br>|
| `Midi CC control number: 4` | Defines the number of the Continuous Controller (CC), which acts as the hi-hat pedal.<br>**You should leave this alone.**</br>|
| `Midi CC threshold: 64` | Defines the middle point the hi-pedal pedal goes from closed to open. |
| `Midi CC invert threshold: false` | Inverts the range for the hi-hat pedal, mentioned above. |

### Remapping
If your MIDI Drum Kit has incompatible mapping, you can remap using `Midi id to note override: ""` with the corrected notes.
* To do this:
	* Go to <a href="https://www.midimonitor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[MIDI Monitor]</a>
	* Play the pad you want to replace to find its MIDI Note number (`Note #[number]`).

The file uses the following note names:

`Kick`  
`HihatPedal`  
`Snare`  
`SnareRim`  
`HiTom`  
`LowTom`  
`FloorTom`  
`HihatWithPedalUp`  
`Hihat`  
`Ride`  
`Crash`

Examples of common replacements:
* Blue cymbal is mapped to `Note #51` and Green cymbals is mapped to `Note #49` and your kit has these reversed.
	* `Midi id to note override: "49=Ride,51=Crash"` will reverse them to be closer to the game's layout
* You want to map Open Hi-Hat to Blue cymbal.
	* `Midi id to note override: "46=Ride"`
